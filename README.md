## Introduction

Minix is a small, lightweight Unix-like operating system. It is known for its microkernel architecture, which makes it a great educational tool for understanding operating systems. This repository aims to provide clear and concise documentation to help users install Minix and work with its system calls.

## Installation Guide

To get started with Minix, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Minix OS**: You can find the latest version of Minix OS in the [Releases section](https://github.com/Rajrohit123/Minix-OS/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system.

2. **Prepare Your Environment**: Ensure that your system meets the requirements for running Minix. You may need to set up a virtual machine or a dedicated partition.

3. **Install Minix**:
   - If you are using a virtual machine, create a new VM and attach the downloaded image.
   - Boot from the image and follow the on-screen instructions to install Minix.

4. **Configuration**: After installation, you may want to configure your system settings. Refer to the configuration section in the documentation for detailed steps.

## System Calls

Minix provides a range of system calls that allow you to interact with the kernel. Understanding these calls is crucial for developing applications on Minix. Here are some key system calls:

- **open()**: Opens a file.
- **read()**: Reads data from a file.
- **write()**: Writes data to a file.
- **close()**: Closes an open file descriptor.

For a complete list of system calls and their usage, refer to the [System Calls Documentation](#).
